# Le Mask

I decided some time mid-February, during(?) the Steal The Spotlight event, that I liked the mask+hood cosmetics of the set far too much to not try to make one for myself. Having recently aquired a 3D printer, and having been recommended a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMsPeLfKPa0) about how to use Blender to model characters from illustrations, I decided to take a gander at making one of these masks for myself!

My initial plan was to use the mask model from in game as a reference to model off of, so I went in game to grab a few profile screenshots of the mask & hood, then took them into Blender (an open source program for 3D modeling, animation and much more). The first attempt went relatively smoothly in Blender, and I was able to print it with little trouble. However the proportions weren't right at all for my head, so I mushed the model around a bit until I had something I thought would work better and printed it out again. And once again, the mask did not fit my head well. 

I will admit, I was a bit cross. I decided that while the in game model was nice and all, I would be better served by using pictures of my own head as references. After a bit of ~~procrastination~~ deliberation, I had a friend take the photos, and I started the process of modeling a rough version of my face. 

After a month of procrastination, I forced myself to get it done and banged out a version on a Friday night and started it printing the next day. As I expected, the first version based on my face did not quite fit right, but it was much closer than either of the models based on the game. Another revision later, and I had something that was just about spot on.

It was at this point that I started to think through how I was going to hold the mask on to my head.

I decided to go with a couple holes in the mask, modeled in, and another two prints down, I had what I hoped was the final rendition of my mask.

NOW
- loops built into the mask with elastic running through
- ~~attach other loops to the mask and run elastic through~~
- ~~some other attachment method?~~
- ~~firm band with notches?~~
- also need
    - accurate sizing (adjust in blender)
